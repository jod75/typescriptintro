Introduction to TypeScript

Here are some questions to kickstart your journey with TypeScript. The provided answers represent one approach to solving them. Have fun!

1. Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. Create a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
3. Write a program that takes a number as input and determines if it's even or odd.
4. Write a program to generate the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
5. Create a program that checks if a given number is a prime number.
6. Fill an array with 10 random integers and display them in ascending order.
7. Create a program that takes a string as input and outputs the reversed version of the string.
8. Write a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
9. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.
10. Write a function that display the numbers from start to end at x interval.  For example if start = 0, end is 10, and interval is 3, then it will display 0, 3, 6, 9.
11. Create a guessing game where the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints if the guess is too high or too low.
12. Convert a decimal number into binary using % (modulo) and / (quotient) operations.  The binary number should be represented by a string.
13. Given a string, list the number of occurrences for each letter.  For example, given the string "Hellooo" the output would be h - 1, e - 1, l - 2, o - 3.
14. Write a function to return the minimum, maximum, and average of an array of integers.  Do not use any Math functions, but simple comparison and arithmetic operations.
15. Use Pythagoras formula to find the length of the hypotenuse, when given the length of the adjacent and opposite sides of a triangle.
16. Write a function to tell you the number of days passed since a given day. Take in consideration leap years.
17. Build a basic to-do list program that allows users to add, remove, and list tasks.
